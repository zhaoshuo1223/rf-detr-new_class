        ```

## Dev Environment

If you plan to contribute to RF-DETR or modify the codebase locally, set up a local development environment using the steps below.

!!! example "Development Setup"

    === "virtualenv"

        ```bash
        # Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory
        git clone --depth 1 -b develop https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr.git
        cd rf-detr

        # Set up a Python virtual environment with a specific Python version (e.g., 3.10)
        python3.10 -m venv venv

        # Activate the virtual environment
        source venv/bin/activate

        # Upgrade pip
        pip install --upgrade pip

        # Install the package in development mode
        pip install -e "."
        ```

    === "uv"

        ```bash
        # Clone the repository and navigate to the root directory
        git clone --depth 1 -b develop https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr.git
        cd rf-detr

        # Pin Python version (optional but recommended)
        uv python pin 3.11

        # Sync environment (creates .venv, installs pinned Python, and installs dependencies)
        uv sync

        # Install the package in development mode with all extras
        uv pip install -e . --all-extras
        ```

## Additional Notes

- Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed.
- For development, it is recommended to use a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.
- If you encounter any issues during installation, refer to the [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section or open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/roboflow/rf-detr).

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues during installation, here are some common solutions:

- **Permission Issues**: Use `pip install --user rfdetr` to install the package for your user only.
- **Dependency Conflicts**: Use a virtual environment to isolate the installation.
- **Python Version**: Ensure you are using Python 3.10 or higher.
