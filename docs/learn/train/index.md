# Train an RF-DETR Model

!!! tip "Key Takeaways"

    - Train detection or segmentation models with a single `model.train(dataset_dir=...)` call
    - Supports both COCO JSON and YOLO dataset formats with automatic detection
    - Fine-tune from COCO-pretrained checkpoints (Nano to 2XLarge) for fastest convergence
    - Built on PyTorch Lightning — use the high-level API or access PTL primitives directly for full control
    - EMA weights, early stopping, and best-model checkpointing are included by default

You can train RF-DETR object detection and segmentation models on a custom dataset using the `rfdetr` Python package, or in the cloud using Roboflow.

This guide describes how to train both an object detection and segmentation RF-DETR model.

## Training paths

RF-DETR provides two training paths:

| Path                                        | When to use                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`RFDETR.train()`** (this page)            | Quickstart, fine-tuning with standard options, Colab notebooks. One call sets up and runs everything.                                               |
| **[Custom Training API](customization.md)** | Custom callbacks, alternative loggers, multi-GPU strategies, integration with external frameworks, or any other customisation of the training loop. |

Both paths run the same underlying PyTorch Lightning stack. `RFDETR.train()` constructs `RFDETRModelModule`, `RFDETRDataModule`, and a `Trainer` internally; the Lightning API page shows how to do the same thing explicitly so you can modify each component.

## Quick Start

RF-DETR supports training on datasets in both **COCO** and **YOLO** formats. The format is automatically detected based on the structure of your dataset directory.

=== "Object Detection"

    ```python
    from rfdetr import RFDETRMedium

    model = RFDETRMedium()

    model.train(
        dataset_dir="<DATASET_PATH>",
        epochs=100,
        batch_size=4,
        grad_accum_steps=4,
        lr=1e-4,
        output_dir="<OUTPUT_PATH>",
    )
    ```

=== "Image Segmentation"

    ```python
    from rfdetr import RFDETRSegMedium

    model = RFDETRSegMedium()

    model.train(
        dataset_dir="<DATASET_PATH>",
        epochs=100,
        batch_size=4,
        grad_accum_steps=4,
        lr=1e-4,
        output_dir="<OUTPUT_PATH>",
    )
    ```

Different GPUs have different VRAM capacities, so adjust batch_size and grad_accum_steps to maintain a total batch size of 16. For example, on a powerful GPU like the A100, use `batch_size=16` and `grad_accum_steps=1`; on smaller GPUs like the T4, use `batch_size=4` and `grad_accum_steps=4`. This gradient accumulation strategy helps train effectively even with limited memory.

For object detection, the RF-DETR-B checkpoint is used by default. To get started quickly with training an object detection model, please refer to our fine-tuning Google Colab [notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-finetune-rf-detr-on-detection-dataset.ipynb).

## Dataset Format

RF-DETR **automatically detects** whether your dataset is in COCO or YOLO format. Simply pass your dataset directory to the `train()` method and the appropriate data loader will be used.

| Format   | Detection Method                         | Learn More                                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **COCO** | Looks for `train/_annotations.coco.json` | [COCO Format Guide](dataset-formats.md#coco-format) |
| **YOLO** | Looks for `data.yaml` + `train/images/`  | [YOLO Format Guide](dataset-formats.md#yolo-format) |

[Roboflow](https://roboflow.com/annotate) allows you to create object detection datasets from scratch and export them in either COCO JSON or YOLO format for training. You can also explore [Roboflow Universe](https://universe.roboflow.com/) to find pre-labeled datasets for a range of use cases.

## Training Configuration

RF-DETR provides many configuration options to customize your training run. See the complete reference for all available parameters.

→ **[View all training parameters](training-parameters.md)**

## Advanced Topics

- [Resume training](advanced.md#resume-training) from a checkpoint
- [Early stopping](advanced.md#early-stopping) to prevent overfitting
- [Multi-GPU training](advanced.md#multi-gpu-training) with PyTorch Lightning DDP
- [Custom augmentations with Albumentations](augmentations.md) - Dedicated guide
- [Memory optimization](advanced.md#memory-optimization) with gradient checkpointing

→ **[Learn more about advanced training](advanced.md)**

## Custom Training API

RF-DETR's training stack is built on PyTorch Lightning. The `RFDETR.train()` call above constructs and runs PTL primitives internally. Use them directly when you need custom callbacks, non-default loggers, multi-GPU strategies, or full control over the training loop.

→ **[Custom Training API guide](customization.md)**

## Training Loggers

Track your experiments with popular logging platforms:

- [TensorBoard](loggers.md#tensorboard) for local visualization
- [Weights and Biases](loggers.md#weights-and-biases) for cloud-based tracking
- [ClearML](loggers.md#clearml) for MLOps automation
- [MLflow](loggers.md#mlflow) for experiment lifecycle management

→ **[Learn more about training loggers](loggers.md)**

## Result Checkpoints

During training, multiple model checkpoints are saved to the output directory:

- `checkpoint.pth` – the most recent checkpoint, saved at the end of the latest epoch.

- `checkpoint_<number>.pth` – periodic checkpoints saved every N epochs (default is every 10).

- `checkpoint_best_ema.pth` – best checkpoint based on validation score, using the EMA (Exponential Moving Average) weights. EMA weights are a smoothed version of the model's parameters across training steps, often yielding better generalization.

- `checkpoint_best_regular.pth` – best checkpoint based on validation score, using the raw (non-EMA) model weights.

- `checkpoint_best_total.pth` – final checkpoint selected for inference and benchmarking. It contains only the model weights (no optimizer state or scheduler) and is chosen as the better of the EMA and non-EMA models based on validation performance.

??? note "Checkpoint file sizes"

    Checkpoint sizes vary based on what they contain:

    - **Training checkpoints** (e.g. `checkpoint.pth`, `checkpoint_<number>.pth`) include model weights, optimizer state, scheduler state, and training metadata. Use these to resume training.

    - **Evaluation checkpoints** (e.g. `checkpoint_best_ema.pth`, `checkpoint_best_regular.pth`) store only the model weights — either EMA or raw — and are used to track the best-performing models. These may come from different epochs depending on which version achieved the highest validation score.

    - **Stripped checkpoint** (e.g. `checkpoint_best_total.pth`) contains only the final model weights and is optimized for inference and deployment.

## Load and Run Fine-Tuned Model

=== "Object Detection"

    ```python
    from rfdetr import RFDETRMedium

    model = RFDETRMedium(pretrain_weights="<CHECKPOINT_PATH>")

    detections = model.predict("<IMAGE_PATH>")
    ```

=== "Image Segmentation"

    ```python
    from rfdetr import RFDETRSegMedium

    model = RFDETRSegMedium(pretrain_weights="<CHECKPOINT_PATH>")

    detections = model.predict("<IMAGE_PATH>")
    ```

## Next Steps

After training your model, you can:

- [Export your model to ONNX](../export.md) for deployment with various inference frameworks
- [Deploy to Roboflow](../deploy.md) for cloud-based inference and workflow integration
